               <h4>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h4>
                <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the boot camp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                  the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
                <p>“ Before joining the boot camp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development 
                  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                  100% recommend! ”</p>

                <h4>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and

                <p>  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
